# Python-Projects
These scripts I made in order to learn python scripting from an ethical hacking perspective. I am very grateful for all that I learned from my Udemy Course Learn
Python & Ethical Hacking from scratch.
I'm still learning how to make my own scripts, but these gave me a solid foundation to such and to expand on them.
In short this is my coursework!
